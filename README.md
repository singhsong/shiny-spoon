> I have measured out my life with coffee spoons...

> In a minute there is time
> For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

> For I have known them all already, known them all:
> Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
> I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
> I know the voices dying with a dying fall
> Beneath the music from a farther room.
>                So how should I presume?
